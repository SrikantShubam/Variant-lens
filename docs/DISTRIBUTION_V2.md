# Distribution V2: Education-First Growth

## Strategy
Become the default teaching tool for variant interpretation before selling to researchers.

## Tactics

### 1. Classroom Pack (Primary)

**Contents:**
- 5 curated variants (different difficulty)
- PDF guide: "Teaching Protein Variant Interpretation"
- Slide deck: "From Sequence to Structure to Function"
- Assignment template with rubric
- Case file import instructions

**Distribution:**
- Direct outreach to 20 biochemistry/bioinformatics professors
- Post on educational forums (BioStars, SEQanswers)
- GitHub release asset

**Success Metric:** 5 courses adopting by Month 3

### 2. GitHub-Native Growth

**Repository Optimization:**
- Topic tags: bioinformatics, education, alphafold, structural-biology, variant-interpretation
- Good first issues: "Add validation variant", "Improve mobile CSS"
- Case file showcase: /examples/ directory

**README Structure:**
- Hero: Screenshot of 3D viewer
- One-liner: "Understand genetic variants in 3D"
- Quickstart: 30-second demo link
- "Used in courses at: [Logos]"
- Citation block ready to copy

### 3. Community Loops

**Contributors:**
- Validation set submissions (credit in file)
- Bug reports (response within 48hrs)
- Translation of case files (i18n prep)

**Recognition:**
- CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Release notes mentions
- Twitter/X acknowledgment (opt-in)

### 4. Content Marketing (Zero Budget)

**Target Platforms:**
- Twitter/X: #bioinformatics #structuralbiology
- LinkedIn: Tag professors, course creators
- YouTube: 2-min demo video (screen capture + voiceover)

**Content Pillars:**
- "Variant of the Week": Deep dive on curated set variant
- "Behind the Case": How validation works
- "Student Spotlight": Course adoption stories

### 5. Integration Partnerships

**Target:**
- Ensembl (link out from variant pages)
- UniProt (community tool listing)
- GTEx (educational resource section)

**Pitch:** "Free, open, validated educational tool for your users"

## Timeline

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Classroom pack v1, outreach to 10 profs |
| 2 | Validation set live, GitHub topics optimized |
| 3 | First course adoption, demo video |
| 4 | Community contribution #1 |
| 6 | 5 courses, 50 forks |

## Anti-Tactics (Avoid)
- No paid ads
- No spamming journal comment sections
- No "disrupting healthcare" positioning
